description: Platform-neutral guidance for using Open Computer Use, the open-source Computer Use MCP server and CLI for macOS, Linux, and Windows. Use when an agent needs to install, verify, troubleshoot, configure, or operate Open Computer Use through its native CLI, stdio MCP server, or direct Computer Use tool calls.

# Open Computer Use

## Overview

Open Computer Use exposes Computer Use as a local CLI and stdio MCP server. It is not Codex.app-specific; adapt the commands and MCP config to the agent runtime you are operating in.

The macOS runtime requires macOS 14.0 or later. Windows and Linux use their own platform runtimes and are not subject to this macOS minimum.

It supports the same core tool surface across macOS, Linux, and Windows:
`list_apps`, `get_app_state`, `click`, `perform_secondary_action`, `scroll`,
`drag`, `type_text`, `press_key`, and `set_value`.

The macOS runtime additionally implements `select_text`, which selects the given text inside a text
element or places the text cursor before / after it (`selection`: `text`, `cursor_before`,
`cursor_after`). Pass `text` exactly as it appears in the accessibility tree, plus `prefix` /
`suffix` when it is not unique; an ambiguous target fails closed instead of silently selecting the
first match. JavaScript exposes `app.selectText(elementIndex, text, options?)`. Unreadable or mismatched range verification throws, including when full action read-back is off. Windows and Linux runtimes do not implement this tool yet.

macOS additionally exposes `query`: a targeted accessibility lookup that finds
controls by text and/or role without rendering a tree or taking a screenshot.
On macOS, `get_app_state` also takes `marks: true`, which labels each actionable element on the
screenshot with its `element_index`, and `zoom: {x, y, width, height}` (fractions of the window),
which returns only that part of the window; coordinate clicks then refer to the zoomed image.

## Core Workflow

1. On macOS, run `sw_vers -productVersion` before invoking the CLI and require macOS 14.0 or later. On older versions, explain that the runtime cannot launch; do not recommend `doctor` or permission changes as a fix for binary incompatibility.
2. Check the CLI is installed with `open-computer-use -h` or `ocu -h`. If installation or setup is missing, read [references/installation.md](references/installation.md).
3. On supported macOS versions, run `open-computer-use doctor` before the first real GUI task. If permissions are missing, ask the user to approve Accessibility and Screen Recording in the onboarding UI.
4. Inspect available apps before acting: `open-computer-use call list_apps`.
5. Capture current UI state with `open-computer-use call get_app_state --args '{"app":"TextEdit"}'`. The default state is usually enough for UI operation.
6. When the task needs longer semantic text, such as chat history, email bodies, document text, or long form content, call `get_app_state` with `text_limit: 1000` or `text_limit: "max"`.
7. When visible long pages or lists appear incomplete even after scrolling, call `get_app_state` with a larger `max_tree_nodes` or `max_tree_depth`.
8. Prefer element-targeted actions using `element_index` from the latest `get_app_state` result.
9. For multi-step CLI work, use `open-computer-use call --calls '<json-array>'` so one process can reuse the latest element index mapping.
10. For agent runtimes that support local MCP servers, configure `open-computer-use mcp` or `ocu mcp` and call the exposed Computer Use tools directly. Read [references/usage.md](references/usage.md).
11. For direct code-first orchestration, run `ocu capabilities` and then use one-shot `ocu js` or persistent `ocu repl`. Read [references/usage.md](references/usage.md).
12. If communication, permission, or desktop-session access fails, read [references/troubleshooting.md](references/troubleshooting.md).

## Operating Rules

- Treat the target desktop as the user's real session. Do not inspect password managers, unrelated private content, or sensitive apps unless the user explicitly asked for that task.
- Ask before sending, deleting, purchasing, approving, uploading, or making other externally visible changes.
- Do not assume Codex.app plugin helpers are available. Use the installed `open-computer-use` / `ocu` CLI or an explicit MCP config.
- Use indexes returned by `get_app_state` or macOS `query` in the same native session; do not guess indexes across sessions or after large UI changes.
- Prefer semantic actions and `set_value` for editable controls. Use coordinate `click`, `scroll`, and `drag` only when the element tree does not expose a safer target.
- On macOS, do not enable `OPEN_COMPUTER_USE_ALLOW_GLOBAL_POINTER_FALLBACKS=1` unless the user explicitly requested `click_method: "global"`, a `drag` that must drive a window-server drag session (window move, drag-select text, Finder drag-and-drop), or other diagnostic behavior that may move the real pointer. Without it `drag` reports `Drag delivered via app_post` and those operations have no effect; see `references/usage.md` for alternatives.
- On Windows and Linux, confirm the command is running inside the logged-in desktop session before assuming GUI automation is available.

## Common CLI Actions

```sh
open-computer-use -h
ocu -h
ocu capabilities --json
ocu js 'nodeRepl.write(6 * 7)'
ocu repl
open-computer-use doctor
open-computer-use call list_apps
ocu call list_apps
open-computer-use call get_app_state --args '{"app":"TextEdit"}'
open-computer-use call get_app_state --args '{"app":"TextEdit","text_limit":1000}'
open-computer-use call get_app_state --args '{"app":"TextEdit","text_limit":"max"}'
open-computer-use call get_app_state --args '{"app":"Google Chrome","max_tree_nodes":3000,"max_tree_depth":96}'
open-computer-use call click --args '{"app":"TextEdit","element_index":"0"}'
open-computer-use call type_text --args '{"app":"TextEdit","text":"Hello from Open Computer Use"}'
```

For a short sequence that reuses state in one process:

```sh
open-computer-use call --calls '[
  {"tool":"get_app_state","args":{"app":"TextEdit"}},
  {"tool":"press_key","args":{"app":"TextEdit","key":"Return"}}
]'
```

## MCP Usage

For runtimes that can launch local MCP servers over stdio, use:

```toml
[mcp_servers.open_computer_use]
command = "open-computer-use"
args = ["mcp"]
```

Read [references/usage.md](references/usage.md) for JSON config examples, direct tool-call patterns, and platform notes.
